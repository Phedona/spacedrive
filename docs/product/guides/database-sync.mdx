# Database sync

<Notice

Database sync is a feature that allows you to sync your library database between devices. Synchrnozing happens in real-time, so you can see changes made on one device reflected on another device almost instantly.

We have been working tirelessly on this feature to make sure it is as seamless as possible. We are excited to share it with you soon.

## Sync Indicator

Alongside the job indicator, a small sync icon will appear when a sync is in progress. Clicking it will reveal the sync manager.

## Sync Manager

The sync manager allows you to see the current sync status, and any errors that may have occured. You can also see the last time a sync was completed.
