# Importing Photos

Spacedrive is designed to be a central location for all your media. This means you can import photos from a variety of sources, including your local hard drive, Apple Photos, Google Photos and more.

## From an SD card

Currently you can add the SD card as a location and copy the files to a specific folder. In an upcoming release we will ship a dedicated interface for importing media, with option to exclude already imported media. It will also use your preference for photo storage and place the new media in the designated folder.

## Importing from Apple Photos

### macOS

Spacedrive will index the contents a .photolibrary on your Mac if it is found within a Location. This will mean original photos, live photos and videos will be imported into Spacedrive.

However one downside to this method is that file names are not preserved and some metadata is lost, along with any edits made and albums created with media in your Apple Photos library.

An importer tool will be shipped in an upcoming release, which will not only import all the missing data, but won't be harmed if you have already indexed that photo library, just append correct metadata to it.

### iOS

Our iOS app is currently in development, and will be able to import photos from your Apple Photos library automatically, keeping it in sync in realtime.

## Importing from Google Photos

This is currently not supported, but will be in the future.
