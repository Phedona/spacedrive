# Jobs

Jobs allow Spacedrive to complete a body of work; a built-in multi-threaded task management system.

Jobs can be paused, resumed, and canceled. Spacedrive will always try to restart jobs that were cut off by a restart or shutdown of Spacedrive.

A small indicator shows in the bottom left when a job is running. Clicking it will reveal the job manager.
